# Welcome To Crypto Dashboard

In this project, we would experimenting with building data pipeline, exploring the Crypto data ecosystem, and practicing some analytics skills.

# Folder Organization

The main working files are found in `working_directory`. This is the current status of the folders

```
crypto-dashboard
|___ data
|    |___ raw
|    |___ transform
|    |___ report
|
|___ notebooks
|

```
Let's try to keep it neat so it would be easier to retrieve files
